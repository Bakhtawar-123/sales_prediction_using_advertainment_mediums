Recently, I completed a data science project on sales prediction using advertainment mediums like TV, radio, and newspaper ads. Through data visualization using the Matplotlib library, we found that TV advertisement outperformed other mediums in terms of sales. But that's not all - by training and testing a linear regression model, we achieved an impressive 89% evaluation of the goodness-of-fit of the model. The results speak for themselves! If you're looking for a data-driven approach to marketing, data science might just be the key.
